It was deleted since the model and its requirements have changed dramatically, so a new initial migration will be created to accurately reflect the new state and relationships of the models in the app. This also ensures the app's database is in sync with the current model." />
    <MESSAGE value="&quot;Add 'Reason' and 'StoreType' fields to client prospecting feature&#10;&#10;The 'Reason' field was added to the 'UpdateRejectProspectStatus', 'UpdateApprovedProspectStatus', 'UpdateRequestProspectStatus', and 'RejectProspectRequest' classes. This is to keep a record of the reason why a prospect status was updated.&#10;&#10;A 'StoreType' field is added to the 'AddNewProspectCommand' class to allow identifying the type of store that is being added as a new prospect. For usability and data tracking purposes, this additional information has become necessary.&quot;" />
    <MESSAGE value="Update approval type, save paths, and variable names&#10;&#10;Adjusted the approval type from &quot;For Delivery&quot; to &quot;For Freebie Approval&quot; and optimized the save path to include client full name for unique identification in ReleasedProspectingRequest.cs. Renamed the variable &quot;Permission&quot; to &quot;Permissions&quot; in AddNewUserRoles.cs for better readability and code consistency. Further, fields in the new prospect request and code clean-up were performed to improve efficiency and maintainability." />
    <MESSAGE value="&quot;Updated approval type and refactored prospect reject request&quot;&#10;&#10;This update brings changes to a couple of areas of the application. First, an adjustment has been made to the 'approval type' changing the 'For Delivery' approval type to 'For Freebie Approval'. This was done to ensure better representation of the current business logic.&#10;&#10;The save path has also been optimized to include the client's full name for unique identification in ReleasedProspectingRequest.cs. This change ensures straightforward and easy tracking of each client's requests.&#10;&#10;A variable named 'Permission' has been renamed to 'Permissions' in AddNewUserRoles.cs to enhance readability and code consistency across the application. &#10;&#10;Lastly, In the RejectProspectRequest.cs, the approval type setting line has been commented out and the HTTP PUT method 'Reject' has been refactored to include the RejectProspectRequestCommand as a parameter.&#10;&#10;All of these changes aim to improve the efficiency, readability, maintainability, and to better align with the application's business logic." />
    <MESSAGE value="Add 'Reason' field to prospecting entities&#10;&#10;A 'Reason' field was added to the RecordClient, GetAllRequestedProspectResult, GetAllRejectProspectResult entities. This field stores the reason why a prospect status was updated, thus providing more context for status changes. Furthermore, a filter was added in 'Handle' method of GetAllRequestedProspectQuery and GetAllRejectProspectQuery, to only get records where 'IsActive' is true. This change makes sure that only relevant data is fetched." />
    <MESSAGE value="Update status checks in prospect feature&#10;&#10;Refined the status checks in the prospecting feature for more accurate queries. Changed the attribute in the 'UpdateRejectProspectStatus.cs' file from 'ApprovalType' to 'Client.RegistrationStatus' to specifically check if the client's registration is rejected. The 'GetAllRequestedProspectAsync.cs' file has been updated to include an additional condition to the `requestedProspect` query. It now checks if the `Client.RegistrationStatus` is 'Requested' along with other conditions, ensuring only relevant results are considered." />
    <MESSAGE value="Refined status checks in prospect feature&#10;&#10;Enhanced the status checks in the prospecting feature for more accurate queries. Changed the attribute in the 'UpdateRejectProspectStatus.cs' file from 'ApprovalType' to 'Client.RegistrationStatus' in order to specifically check if the client's registration is rejected. The 'GetAllRequestedProspectAsync.cs' file has been updated to include an additional condition to the `requestedProspect` query. The query now also checks if the `Client.RegistrationStatus` is 'Requested' along with other conditions. All these changes are designed to ensure only relevant results are considered during the queries process, enhancing the overall efficiency of the prospecting feature." />
    <MESSAGE value="Refined query filters for prospect retrieval&#10;&#10;The query filters used in GetAllRejectProspectAsync and GetAllApprovedProspectAsync methods in the Client prospecting feature have been modified. Removed the IsActive and IsApproved conditions from the Rejected prospects retrieval, as they were deemed unnecessary. Added IsActive and IsApproved conditions to Approved prospects retrieval to ensure only active and approved prospects are returned. These changes optimize prospect data retrieval and ensure data accuracy." />
    <MESSAGE value="Refine query filters for GetAllRequestedProspectAsync&#10;&#10;Simplified the query filters used in GetAllRequestedProspectAsync method for prospecting feature in the API. Removed redundant conditions (ApprovalType == &quot;Approver Approval&quot;, IsApproved == false, IsActive) in the method to get requested prospects, now only checking if Client.RegistrationStatus is &quot;Requested&quot;. This change was necessary to optimize the query execution and improve data accuracy by removing unnecessary conditions." />
    <MESSAGE value="Refine prospect requests query to include approval status&#10;&#10;In this update, prospect requests queries were adjusted across requests ('Requested', 'Rejected', and 'Released'). The queries now incorporate the 'IsApproved' property to ensure that the results reflect the current approval status and avoid returning prospects that have been already approved. In addition, the 'IsActive' check has been removed from the 'Released' prospect request to avoid unnecessary filtering, as being 'Approved' inherently signifies being active." />
    <MESSAGE value="Refactor prospect request query to improve data accuracy&#10;&#10;The query filters in prospect requests ('Requested', 'Rejected', and 'Released') were adjusted to better reflect the current approval status. The 'IsApproved' property is now included in the queries to ensure that the resulting data is not cluttered with prospects that have already been approved. Additionally, the 'IsActive' check was removed from the 'Released' prospect request query to prevent unnecessary filtering. These changes significantly improve the data precision and optimize query execution." />
    <MESSAGE value="Remove 'Reason' from Prospect Status Update &#10;&#10;No longer capturing 'Reason' in three different prospecting status updates: Rejected, Approved, and Request. The 'Reason' field has been commented out in 'UpdateRejectProspectStatusCommand', 'UpdateApprovedProspectStatusCommand' and 'UpdateRequestProspectStatusCommand'. Moreover, the 'Reason' assignment has been removed from the respective handlers.&#10;&#10;The requirement to record a reason for changing the prospecting status was dropped, simplifying code and the user interface." />
    <MESSAGE value="Add update prospect feature and refactor model and mapping &#10;&#10;This commit introduces a new class (UpdateApprovedProspect.cs) for updating an approved prospect and a new file (GetAllRejectedFreebies.cs) to fetch all rejected freebies, enhancing prospect and freebie features. It also refines the 'FreebieRequest.cs', adding a 'Status' field and a foreign key relationship for 'Clients', which will help in managing freebie requests efficiently. &#10;Changes have been made to 'ProspectingMappingProfiles.cs', 'GetAllRequestedProspectAsync.cs', 'GetAllRejectProspectAsync.cs' and 'GetAllApprovedProspectAsync.cs' files adding `StoreType` to the returned result, which provides more detailed information about the prospect's shop." />
    <MESSAGE value="&quot;Add functionality to update approved prospect&#10;&#10;A new functionality was added to update an approved prospect using `UpdateApprovedProspectCommand`. This feature was added to `UpdateApprovedProspect.cs` file in the prospecting features. This new functionality enables updating the details of any approved prospect.&#10;&#10;Also, file renaming took place for `UpdateProspectRequest.cs` to `UpdateProspectInformation.cs` for aligning the function name with its purpose, providing up-to-date and accurate information of the prospect. And a new condition was added to check for 'Approver Approval' when a client is being updated.&#10;&#10;These changes allow managing approved prospects more effectively, ensuring data consistency, readability, and maintainability.&quot;" />
    <MESSAGE value="&quot;Add new features, enhance existing ones and refactor related files&#10;&#10;Added UpdateFreebiesInformation feature to allow updating freebies. This not only enhances the functionality of the application but, also grants the flexibility to manipulate freebie data efficiently for users. Created UserRoleAlreadyTaggedException for error handling. Also, included 'User' field in some queries in GetUserRolesAsync. Enhanced IsTagged check and included the refaction in UserRoleMappingExtension. Removed unnecessary 'Domain' namespace from GetAllRequestedProspectAsync. In AddNewUSer.cs, added a new additional check to throw UserRoleAlreadyTaggedException if the user role is already in use. These amendments were a necessity to deliver extended functionality, more readable and reliable data to users, with the commitment to data consistency.&quot;" />
    <MESSAGE value="Update Freebie management and Prospecting enhancements&#10;&#10;Updated the Freebies management by allowing the removal of items from a Freebie request. Added a new status &quot;Released&quot; for Prospecting and improved the query result details for approved Freebies. &#10;&#10;These changes allow the application to track the status of Prospecting and the Freebie requests in a more detailed and efficient manner. Now it is possible to remove items from a Freebie request. For Prospecting, a new status &quot;Released&quot; was introduced to clearly distinguish the delivery status of the client. On top of that, the return details for approved Freebies was enhanced to include the FreebieRequestId and ClientId, providing more visibility and control for the management." />
    <MESSAGE value="Remove Prospecting feature code and Add StoreType setup&#10;&#10;Removed the Prospecting feature code as it was not required anymore due to change in business requirements. Also added functionality to Setup Store Types. This includes adding new store types and getting all store types. Ensured that duplicate store types can't be added by adding a unique constraint. Updated the data migration context and the snapshot to reflect these changes." />
    <MESSAGE value="Add IsActive field to StoreType model&#10;&#10;This commit introduces a new field 'IsActive' to the StoreType model. The field is set to true by default when a new StoreType is created. This allows us to easily track and filter active store types." />
    <option name="LAST_COMMIT_MESSAGE" value="Add IsActive field to StoreType model&#10;&#10;This commit introduces a new field 'IsActive' to the StoreType model. The field is set to true by default when a new StoreType is created. This allows us to easily track and filter active store types." />

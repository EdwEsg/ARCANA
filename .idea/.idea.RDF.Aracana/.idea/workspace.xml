The 'IsActive' check has been removed to streamline the update process. This allows for more flexibility when changing the status of a client.&#10;&#10;Additionally, in the Freebies feature, un-commented the code which had been previously suppressed, making the 'ApproveFreebies' feature available. It now supports image uploads and handles file-saving, providing a more robust solution for approving freebies. &#10;&#10;Both these changes are aimed at improving usability and simplifying the codebase.">

    <MESSAGE value="Change the StoreType field to StoreTypeId in the Clients model&#10;&#10;Modified the Clients model to replace the StoreType string field with the StoreTypeId int field. This change was made to represent the relationship between the Clients and the StoreType models, making the database structure more appropriate and more convenient for manipulations. The mapping profiles and data context were also updated accordingly to reflect this change." />
    <MESSAGE value="&quot;Include StoreType in client prospecting responses&#10;&#10;For better understandability and ease of access, the StoreType of the client is now included in the response of the queries fetching the details of clients in different statuses. This is achieved by modifying the clauses related to clients in the GetAllRequestedProspectAsync, GetAllRejectProspectAsync, GetAllReleasedProspectingRequest, and GetAllApprovedProspectAsync models under the prospecting feature. Therefore, detailed client information can now be fetched in a single request, reducing the necessity of sequential API calls and hence improving efficiency.&quot;" />
    <MESSAGE value="Add StoreTypeId to UpdateProspectInformation request&#10;&#10;A new field, StoreTypeId, is now included in the UpdateProspectInformation request. This change was necessary because our system now accommodates different types of stores, requiring the prospect clients to provide this additional information when updating their details. This makes the client data more categorized and easier to manage." />
    <MESSAGE value="Add Modules model and update relations with UserRoles&#10;&#10;Added a new entity `Modules` and updated relations in the `UserRoles` model.

The intent is to better organize user privileges as modules rather than using an unstructured collection of permissions." />
    <MESSAGE value="&quot;Removed Modules entity and refactored UserRole permissions&#10;&#10;In this commit, the 'Modules' entity has been removed as it was found to be unnecessary. The permissions system within the 'UserRoles' entity has been refactored from being a collection of 'ModuleId' to a collection of strings. This provides the same functionality with a simpler implementation. Other classes which used the 'Modules' class such as 'GetUsersAsync' and 'AuthenticateUser' have been updated to reflect these changes as well. The file 'Module.cs' was deleted.&quot;" />
    <MESSAGE value="Removed Modules entity and refactored UserRole permissions&#10;&#10;Modules entity was determined to be unnecessary and was therefore removed. The permissions within the UserRoles entity have been refactored, changing from a collection of ModuleId to a collection of strings.

All classes that utilized the Modules entity, such as GetUsersAsync and AuthenticateUser, have been updated accordingly." />
    <MESSAGE value="Refactor permissions system and enhance Freebies query&#10;&#10;This commit introduces two main changes: &#10;1. The 'Modules' entity, which was previously used for managing permissions within the 'UserRoles' entity, has been removed as it was found to be unnecessary. The permissions system within the 'UserRoles' entity has been refactored from being a collection of 'ModuleId' to a collection of strings. This change simplifies the implementation, while preserving functionality. All classes that utilized the 'Modules' entity, such as 'GetUsersAsync' and 'AuthenticateUser', have been updated accordingly.&#10;2. The 'GetRequestedFreebies' query result class in the 'Freebies' feature of the API has been expanded to include the 'ClientId' property. This enhancement provides additional information in the output, allowing clients to be uniquely identified by their IDs, resulting in more efficient data lookup and management." />
    <MESSAGE value="Update Freebies information and refactor permissions&#10;&#10;Modified the UpdateFreebiesInformation class to add RequestId to the FreebieItems. This detail offers more information about the freebies request, helping in data tracking and management. Also, refactored permission system for UserRoles. The previously used 'Modules' entity was found superfluous and replaced with a collection of strings. This change simplifies implementation and maintains functionality." />
    <MESSAGE value="Optimized Approved Prospect query&#10;&#10;Extended the 'GetAllApprovedProspect' query to include 'FreebieRequest' items that are null.

    <MESSAGE value="&quot;Optimized Approved Prospect query&quot;&#10;&#10;In this update, the 'GetAllApprovedProspect' query has been optimized to include 'FreebieRequest' items which are null. This has been done to streamline the data pulling process, delivering only necessary data to the client, and thus reducing the usage of resources. The change was needed due to the identified inefficiencies in the current data retrieval process." />
    <MESSAGE value="&quot;Optimized data retrieval for prospective clients&quot;&#10;&#10;Extended the GetAllApprovedProspect query to include not only 'FreebieRequest' items that are null but also check if the client's status is &quot;Approved&quot;. This addition was made to streamline the data retrieval process, returning only the necessary data and thus reducing resource utilization. The change was prompted due to identified inefficiencies in the current data retrieval process. &#10;&#10;In addition, Reject and Request Freebies class methods now contain better context for rejecting and requesting freebies and logic for updating the client's registration status, focusing on improving the readability and maintainability of the code." />

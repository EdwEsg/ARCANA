This new functionality allows approved clients to request freebies. This involves changes in multiple files involving domain, status, data context, RequestFreebies, ApprovedClient, and User files. This change was necessary to extend the shopping facility to reward dedicated customers with freebies based on their engagement in order to improve customer retention and increase repeat purchases. As a result, a new model 'Freebies' has been introduced with relationships to multiple existing entities in the system such firebase status, user, items, and approved clients. Furthermore, extra caution has been implemented to avoid allowing rejected clients from requesting freebies. New exceptions have been readied to handle such failures. Such changes provide a comprehensive and safe update to the system as well as the database schema via migrations.">

The queries now incorporate the 'IsApproved' property to ensure that the results reflect the current approval status and avoid returning prospects that have been already approved. In addition, the 'IsActive' check has been removed from the 'Released' prospect request to avoid unnecessary filtering, as being 'Approved' inherently signifies being active." />
    <MESSAGE value="Refactor prospect request query to improve data accuracy&#10;&#10;The query filters in prospect requests ('Requested', 'Rejected', and 'Released') were adjusted to better reflect the current approval status. The 'IsApproved' property is now included in the queries to ensure that the resulting data is not cluttered with prospects that have already been approved. Additionally, the 'IsActive' check was removed from the 'Released' prospect request query to prevent unnecessary filtering. These changes significantly improve the data precision and optimize query execution." />
    <MESSAGE value="Remove 'Reason' from Prospect Status Update &#10;&#10;No longer capturing 'Reason' in three different prospecting status updates: Rejected, Approved, and Request. The 'Reason' field has been commented out in 'UpdateRejectProspectStatusCommand', 'UpdateApprovedProspectStatusCommand' and 'UpdateRequestProspectStatusCommand'. Moreover, the 'Reason' assignment has been removed from the respective handlers.&#10;&#10;The requirement to record a reason for changing the prospecting status was dropped, simplifying code and the user interface." />
    <MESSAGE value="Add update prospect feature and refactor model and mapping &#10;&#10;This commit introduces a new class (UpdateApprovedProspect.cs) for updating an approved prospect and a new file (GetAllRejectedFreebies.cs) to fetch all rejected freebies, enhancing prospect and freebie features. It also refines the 'FreebieRequest.cs', adding a 'Status' field and a foreign key relationship for 'Clients', which will help in managing freebie requests efficiently. &#10;Changes have been made to 'ProspectingMappingProfiles.cs', 'GetAllRequestedProspectAsync.cs', 'GetAllRejectProspectAsync.cs' and 'GetAllApprovedProspectAsync.cs' files adding `StoreType` to the returned result, which provides more detailed information about the prospect's shop." />
    <MESSAGE value="&quot;Add functionality to update approved prospect&#10;&#10;A new functionality was added to update an approved prospect using `UpdateApprovedProspectCommand`. This feature was added to `UpdateApprovedProspect.cs` file in the prospecting features. This new functionality enables updating the details of any approved prospect.&#10;&#10;Also, file renaming took place for `UpdateProspectRequest.cs` to `UpdateProspectInformation.cs` for aligning the function name with its purpose, providing up-to-date and accurate information of the prospect. And a new condition was added to check for 'Approver Approval' when a client is being updated.&#10;&#10;These changes allow managing approved prospects more effectively, ensuring data consistency, readability, and maintainability.&quot;" />
    <MESSAGE value="&quot;Add new features, enhance existing ones and refactor related files&#10;&#10;Added UpdateFreebiesInformation feature to allow updating freebies. This not only enhances the functionality of the application but, also grants the flexibility to manipulate freebie data efficiently for users. Created UserRoleAlreadyTaggedException for error handling. Also, included 'User' field in some queries in GetUserRolesAsync. Enhanced IsTagged check and included the refaction in UserRoleMappingExtension. Removed unnecessary 'Domain' namespace from GetAllRequestedProspectAsync. In AddNewUSer.cs, added a new additional check to throw UserRoleAlreadyTaggedException if the user role is already in use. These amendments were a necessity to deliver extended functionality, more readable and reliable data to users, with the commitment to data consistency.&quot;" />
    <MESSAGE value="Update Freebie management and Prospecting enhancements&#10;&#10;Updated the Freebies management by allowing the removal of items from a Freebie request. Added a new status &quot;Released&quot; for Prospecting and improved the query result details for approved Freebies. &#10;&#10;These changes allow the application to track the status of Prospecting and the Freebie requests in a more detailed and efficient manner. Now it is possible to remove items from a Freebie request. For Prospecting, a new status &quot;Released&quot; was introduced to clearly distinguish the delivery status of the client. On top of that, the return details for approved Freebies was enhanced to include the FreebieRequestId and ClientId, providing more visibility and control for the management." />

Also added functionality to Setup Store Types. This includes adding new store types and getting all store types. Ensured that duplicate store types can't be added by adding a unique constraint.

    <MESSAGE value="Add IsActive field to StoreType model&#10;&#10;This commit introduces a new field 'IsActive' to the StoreType model. The field is set to true by default when a new StoreType is created. This allows us to easily track and filter active store types." />
    <MESSAGE value="Change the StoreType field to StoreTypeId in the Clients model&#10;&#10;Modified the Clients model to replace the StoreType string field with the StoreTypeId int field. This change was made to represent the relationship between the Clients and the StoreType models, making the database structure more appropriate and more convenient for manipulations. The mapping profiles and data context were also updated accordingly to reflect this change." />
    <MESSAGE value="&quot;Include StoreType in client prospecting responses&#10;&#10;For better understandability and ease of access, the StoreType of the client is now included in the response of the queries fetching the details of clients in different statuses. This is achieved by modifying the clauses related to clients in the GetAllRequestedProspectAsync, GetAllRejectProspectAsync, GetAllReleasedProspectingRequest, and GetAllApprovedProspectAsync models under the prospecting feature. Therefore, detailed client information can now be fetched in a single request, reducing the necessity of sequential API calls and hence improving efficiency.&quot;" />

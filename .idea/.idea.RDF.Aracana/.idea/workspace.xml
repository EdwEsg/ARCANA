It also changes a method in UpdateMeatTypeStatus.cs from HTTP PUT to HTTP PATCH to align with REST principles. A new file, GetRequestedProspectById.cs, has been added to handle specific requests." />
    <MESSAGE value="Change ProductCategoryId to ProductSubCategoryId in AddNewItems&#10;&#10;Refactored the 'AddNewItems' class to replace 'ProductCategoryId' with 'ProductSubCategoryId' in response to a change in categorization logic. Instead of assigning items to a product category, they will now belong to a more specific sub-category, enhancing product management and filtering." />
    <MESSAGE value="&quot;Fixed incorrect query for ProductSubCategory in AddNewItems&#10;&#10;The query to validate the subcategory of the product was mistakenly using 'ProductCategoryId'. The correct field to use is 'ProductSubCategoryId'. This change ensures that the correct subcategory is validated before adding a new item.&quot;" />
    <MESSAGE value="Add Id field to UpdateItemCommand class&#10;&#10;Added an Id property to the UpdateItemCommand class. Replaced the retrieval and validation of items with the Id property instead of ItemCode. The change was made because using an Id is a more reliable way to specifically identify items in the database. The item retrieval and validation have been updated accordingly, plus the Update method now accepts the Id as parameter for more accurate data handling." />
    <MESSAGE value="Update item identification from string to int&#10;&#10;Changed the ItemCode in UpdateItemStatusCommand and its related codes from string to int. This change is implemented to make the item identification more consistent and efficient across the application. Also, integer IDs are easier to manage and manipulate." />
    <MESSAGE value="Add functionality to request freebies by approved clients&#10;&#10;A new feature has been added. This new functionality allows approved clients to request freebies. This involves changes in multiple files involving domain, status, data context, RequestFreebies, ApprovedClient, and User files. This change was necessary to extend the shopping facility to reward dedicated customers with freebies based on their engagement in order to improve customer retention and increase repeat purchases. As a result, a new model 'Freebies' has been introduced with relationships to multiple existing entities in the system such firebase status, user, items, and approved clients. Furthermore, extra caution has been implemented to avoid allowing rejected clients from requesting freebies. New exceptions have been readied to handle such failures. Such changes provide a comprehensive and safe update to the system as well as the database schema via migrations." />
    <MESSAGE value="Set default value for CreatedAt, fix id parameter, enhance RequestFreebies&#10;&#10;Set default value for CreatedAt field in Freebies model to prevent missing date records on creation. Changed &quot;FromQuery&quot; to &quot;FromRoute&quot; in UpdateTermDaysStatus method to correctly get id from the URI.

The status of the clients whether they are active or not, is now part of our detailed mapping.&#10;&#10;In the DataContext, new entities of approved and rejected freebies were also introduced. These modifications are needed to handle the expanded business logic related to the management of freebies which comes with an approval or rejection process. &#10;&#10;The IsActive field and mentioned models implemented provide more efficient data extraction and improve the efficiency of the response, considering the application's evolving needs and demand." />
    <MESSAGE value="Add RejectedFreebies, ApprovedFreebies, update ApproveFreebies flow&#10;&#10;Created new domain classes 'RejectedFreebies' and 'ApprovedFreebies' to manage freebies that are approved or rejected. Updated the 'ApproveFreebies' flow to use these new classes and include the feature of attaching photo proof for approved freebies. This helps structure the data more efficiently and enhances the approval process by adding an extra layer of verification with photo proof." />
    <MESSAGE value="Update data storage strategy and fix typos in API routes&#10;&#10;Updated storage method for photo evidence from directly saving as binary to storing file path in `ApprovedFreebies.cs` to optimize database storage. Fixed incorrect API routes from `api/Propspecting` to `api/Prospecting` in `UpdateRejectProspectStatus.cs`, `GetRequestedProspectById.cs`, `UpdateApprovedProspectStatus.cs`, and `UpdateRequestProspectStatus.cs` files for accurate mapping.

    <option name="LAST_COMMIT_MESSAGE" value="Refine prospect requests query to include approval status&#10;&#10;In this update, prospect requests queries were adjusted across requests ('Requested', 'Rejected', and 'Released'). The queries now incorporate the 'IsApproved' property to ensure that the results reflect the current approval status and avoid returning prospects that have been already approved. In addition, the 'IsActive' check has been removed from the 'Released' prospect request to avoid unnecessary filtering, as being 'Approved' inherently signifies being active." />
